This is real rough. :)

Start by creating a virtualenv & pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure you have a local copy of PostgreSQL running.

Edit model.py and update sa_url and dsn in three places to fix connection params (sorry).

Then, run: ./model.py to create a PostgreSQL database

Then, edit __main__ in symbols.py to point it at a directory of some files containing paths to symbol files. :)

BUGS
* PUBLIC records aren't added yet
* Need to implement ranges for STACK records

TODO
* Make this configman'd
